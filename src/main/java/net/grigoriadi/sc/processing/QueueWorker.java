/**
 * A worker polling items from an priority queue, and putting them for marshalling.
 * This worker is designed as a single thread worker only.
 *
 * Given the requirement that data on output stream are ordered, rule for item being available to poll from a queue is:
 * All running clients parsing data, "are ahead" of the head item in the queue.
 *
 * Eg. if head item time is 10, worker is waiting for all running clients to have received at least time 11.
 * (Data stream per client are ordered by contract).
 * @see ClientDataRegistry#allClientsAhead(Long)
 * When client is done processing stream it sets Long.MAX_VALUE as its last received date, so the queue can be drained to tail.
 *
 * Time instants in queue are "distinct", they not duplicate each other.
 * Sum amount for each item is held in "Item Sum" map in app context. Where sums are pushed by clients.
